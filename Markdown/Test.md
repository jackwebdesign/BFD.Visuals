# School Sucks
School can often feel overwhelming and frustrating for many students. The pressure of constant assignments, exams, and strict schedules can make it difficult to enjoy learning. Sometimes, the subjects taught may not feel relevant to real life, and the lack of flexibility can stifle creativity and personal interests. These challenges can lead to stress and make school seem like a tough and unenjoyable experience.
